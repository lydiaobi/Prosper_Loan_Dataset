## Dataset

The dataset is a loan data named Prosper \loan. The data contains 113937, and 81 variales.
The main purpose is to deduced the variables that might affect the loa status ad also to get ideas aout their relationship using statistics and visualization.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, i foud out that there are different class of individual request for loan. However, it was observed that individual with monthly salary takes more loan compared to students. This might be to the fact that as a monthly earner, the chances of paying back is higher. self-employed individuals recorded the highest defaulters compared to those employed. 

Between monthly income and loan status, there is a negative correlation due to income been low. BorrowerAPI was high for less loan less loan and low for high low amount. There is also a moderate correlation between BorrowerAPR and monthly income which indicate that while both variables tend to go down.


## Key Insights for Presentation
In the presentation, I focus on the IncomeRange, EmploymentStatus, LoanStatus, Occupation.
I start by introducing the variable, followed by the pattern in carat distribution, then plot the transformed scatterplot.
Also, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. I plotted a graph with different variales ranges from Employmet status,
Loan Status, Occupation, and Income range.
I used the boxplot and point plot to find the relationship between the variables.
 I also made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
